Projects with tkinter in Python

Here you will find, inside the FrontEnd class, allocated in tkinter_basic_application.py, some other useful classes to use:

- class RootElement: defines if app is resizable and size of program.
- class BasicElement: most basic element you need. Superclass to others.
- class DynamicElement: use this to show changing information.
- class InputElement: use this to input information to use on any inside logic.
- class BinaryElement: use this to choose between yes or no. Can be adapted to more options.
- class LoadbarElement: use this to show a loading bar.
- class GifElement: use this to show a gif element. Can change between a idle and action gif.

The two methods inside the class use the threading module to update dynamic information.

Adapt everything as you need!
